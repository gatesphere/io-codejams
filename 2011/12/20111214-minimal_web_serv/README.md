Minimal Web Server
==================
Io Codejam 20111214

This is a minimal web server a la `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`.  Turns the current working directory into a webroot served on port 8000.

To run, just do a:

    ./server.io
    
Needs the Socket addon, obviously.  Heavily based on the MinimalWebServer.io sample.

As you can tell, my current obsession is with client-server code.

**UPDATE 20111215**: Now sends proper headers (404 and 200).
