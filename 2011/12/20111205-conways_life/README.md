Conway's Game of Life:
======================
Io Codejam - 20111205

This is a simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life.

To create a GoL system of dimensions x,y:

    c := Conway with(x,y)
    
To display:

    c display
    
To iterate:

    c iterate
    

Play around with different values on line 15 - this is essentially the live-cell density function for initial layout.
