This is a simple implementation of a Wolfram code one-dimensional cellular automata.  It is very easy to use.

To create a new system, say rule 90, with a 50 cell world, just do:

    c := CellularAutomata with(50,90)
    
To display:

    c display
    
To iterate:

    c iterate
    

A sample program generating Sierpinski's triangle is included.

    ./sierpinski.io
