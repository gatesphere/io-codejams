Io Codejams
============

This is a collection of small, simple, and interesting programs written in the 
[Io programming language](http://iolanguage.com/) in under an hour each.  I hope to have at least 3 a week up here.

More complex programs may take the form of a multi-part codejam, where each part
is written in an hour.  I don't know yet, we'll see where this goes.

If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, mail me at suschord@suspended-chord.info.
